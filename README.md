Project Description Document
Project Title: Real Trust - Consultation, Design, & Marketing
Technologies Used: MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)

Project Overview
The Real Trust project is a full-stack web application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This project includes a user-friendly frontend interface, as well as a backend API to handle user interactions, data storage, and email subscription functionalities.
The primary goal of this application is to provide potential clients with an easy-to-navigate platform where they can:
Learn more about the company's consultation, design, and marketing services.
Submit contact details for further consultation.
Subscribe to email updates.
View projects and client reviews to better understand the company's offerings.
Features and Functionalities
1. Frontend (React.js)
User Interface: The frontend is built in React.js and provides a responsive, clean, and easy-to-use user interface that aligns with the company's branding. The design follows the reference photo provided by the client to ensure a consistent look and feel.
Dynamic Components:
Project Display: Lists projects fetched from the backend, allowing users to view detailed information about each project.
Client Reviews: Displays testimonials from past clients, fetched from the backend.
Contact Form: Allows users to fill out a form with their details (name, email, mobile number, city) to request a free consultation. Form submissions are securely sent to the backend.
Subscription Feature: A simple email subscription input lets users subscribe to future updates. Submitted email addresses are stored in the backend database for future marketing or informational purposes.
2. Backend (Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB)
API Development: The backend was developed with Node.js and Express.js to create an API that manages the following functionalities:
Project Data Retrieval: Provides endpoints to fetch details about various projects.
Client Reviews Retrieval: Serves client reviews, which are displayed on the frontend.
Contact Form Submission: Handles contact form submissions and stores the data in MongoDB for easy reference and future follow-up.
Email Subscription: Accepts and stores user emails for future marketing efforts.
Database: MongoDB is used to store all relevant data, including:
Projects
Client reviews
Contact form details
Subscribed user emails
Security: All data stored in MongoDB is secured with proper access control and authentication through MongoDB Atlas.
3. Deployment
Frontend: The frontend (React app) is deployed on a static hosting provider, such as Vercel, to ensure fast loading and optimal performance.
Backend: The backend API is also hosted on Vercel, with an accessible endpoint URL provided to the frontend to make API calls.
Environment Variables: Sensitive information, such as MongoDB connection strings, API keys, and other private details, are stored securely using environment variables, which are not exposed in the codebase.

Technical Details
Frontend Development (React.js):
All components are built as modular React components, allowing for code reuse and easier maintenance.
A clean, responsive layout, optimized for desktop and mobile views, ensures accessibility across all devices.
Forms are validated on the frontend for required fields to improve user experience.
Backend Development (Express.js and Node.js):
RESTful API endpoints are created for each major functionality (project retrieval, review fetching, contact form submissions, and subscription handling).
Express middleware is used for handling CORS, JSON parsing, and error handling.
The backend is connected to a MongoDB Atlas database, with access controlled via a secure connection string.
Database (MongoDB):
The database is structured to handle collections for projects, client reviews, contact submissions, and subscribed emails.
MongoDB Atlas provides a secure and scalable solution for handling the projectâ€™s data requirements.

Conclusion
The Real Trust project is a well-structured and functional full-stack application that provides an easy-to-use platform for clients to engage with the company's services, submit inquiries, and stay updated through subscriptions. Built using the MERN stack, the application demonstrates modern web development practices, security best practices, and seamless frontend-backend integration.
